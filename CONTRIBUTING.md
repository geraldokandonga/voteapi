# How to contribute

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to VoteApiNamibia, which is hosted on Geraldo Kandonga Fillipus's on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the VoteNamibia of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to dev@vote.com.na.

## Testing

Test your code before submitting and write RSpec examples for new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to VotNamibiaApi](https://github.com/geraldokandonga/voteapi/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include RSpec examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

# However this page is still being updated, you can also contribute by updating this document.

Thanks,
Geraldo Kandonga Fillipus
